The purpose of this analysis was to identify a bacteria to be used as meat flavoring for an alternative meat company named Improbable Beef.  The study collected samples from numerous volunteer's belly buttons to determine amount and specific species of bacteria growing inside their belly button.  The data provided was used to create a bar chart displaying the Top Ten Bacteria Cultures In Sample, a bubble chart displaying All Bacteria Cultures Per Sample and a gauge chart displaying the Belly Button Wash Frequency Per Week.  A dashboard was created  to investigate the sample data available to look at the top 10 bacterial species for each belly button bacteria sample. In addition, if Improbable Beef were to identify a species of bacteria as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
